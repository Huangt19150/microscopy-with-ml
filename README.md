## üß¨ Progress so far: try for yourself!

## üîç Status Summary

- Improved mask generation based on *watershed* method (Ref: [topcoders](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-bowl-2018/discussion/54741))

- Instance reconstruction using *watershed* method achieves 99% fidelity

- Class imbalance: Minor class (*split-line*) is not learning effectively

Although the current results are still underperforming a baseline reference, the repo documents methods, experiments, learnings, and future directions in this space.

‚úÖ Work in progress  
‚úÖ Research-focused

## üß™ Current Experiments

| Model              | Augmentation       | Accuracy | F1 Score | Notes                          |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| ResNet18 (baseline) | Horizontal flips    | 73.2%    | 0.702    | Initial baseline               |
| EfficientNet-B0    | Flip + brightness   | 75.6%    | 0.715    | Slightly better generalization |
| SimCLR (SSL)       | No labels           | TBD      | TBD      | Ongoing training               |

üß† Ideas in progress:
- Self-supervised pretraining (SimCLR, BYOL)
- Explainability with Grad-CAM
- Cell segmentation with UNet
- Class imbalance handling via focal loss

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Confusion matrix
- Grad-CAM visualizations (planned)

---

## üìà Current Results

üìâ So far, none of the trained models outperform a basic [reference model or published baseline], but several hypotheses are being tested:

- Label noise in dataset?
- Underfitting due to resolution?
- Class imbalance?

Model logs, experiments, and plots are tracked in `/notebooks` and `/logs`.

## üõ† How to Run

Basic setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/microscopy-cv-wip.git
cd microscopy-cv-wip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py --config configs/resnet18.yaml
```

To visualize results:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/eval_visualization.ipynb
```

## üìö More Backgrounds & References

- Why interested in nuclei segmentation - logical line
 - Nuclei segmentation remains to be very challenging, especially in histological images (e.g. whole slide image), and useful in various microscopic imaging modalities (fluorecent, bright-field, etc).
 - DSB 2018 was an interesting effort trying to generalize across multiple modalities, but the top-score still leaves big room for improvement, where great advance in recent years could potentially help with (ViT etc.)
 - Start from an "easier" - more homogenus dataset, apply a smart trick borrowed from the top-score solution from DSB 2018. This project aims at to replicate a successful baseline first, then generalized to more complex datasets.
